# Writing an Interpreter in ~~Go~~ Python

I am working through Thorsten Ball's book _Writing an Interpreter in Go_, because I find programming languages fascinating and want to understand them better. I've always loved projects that require me to build my own something... that seems to be the best way for me to learn something new.

However, I didn't want to just copy down code, as it is too easy to not take the time to understand it, even if you want to. I decided instead to write in Python, which enables me to level up my Python skills, and forces me to understand the underlying concepts of writing a programming language interpreter much more deeply than if I was just copying code.

I have found that learning deep, complex things like how computers work at the logic-gate and chip level helps me think about my own programs in more effective and powerful ways, and I hope to get the same out of this project.
